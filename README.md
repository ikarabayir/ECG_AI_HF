# Getting Started
1. The python versions and libraries you have should meet above.
2. Get the code $ git clone the repo and install the dependencies
3. For building the ECG-AI models from scratch for 10 year prediction of HF, run the .py file in the directory. In the .py file, it is also provided how to get the final prediction for an ECG.
